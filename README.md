# Charge Density Wave of 1T-TaS2 using Scanning Tunneling Microscope
I. Introduction 
I used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data to understand the electronic properties in the material 1T-TaS2. TaS2 is a material that hosts charge density waves (CDWs). A CDW is a modulation in an electron density within a metal and is accompanied by a periodic lattice distortion and an electronic gap. STM is a reliable tool to observe the atomic structure of a material and how charges arrange themselves. Scientists still do not understand CDW properties on an atomic scale. Studying CDW states above and below their transition temperature will give us an insight into CDW formation and properties.
